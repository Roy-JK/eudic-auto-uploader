# 🎧 Eudic Auto Uploader

**Eudic Auto Uploader** is a comprehensive Python automation tool designed to streamline the workflow of managing audio content for the "Eudic" (每日英语听力) platform.

It automatically fetches audio episodes from specified RSS feeds (BBC, CNN, Apple News, etc.) and uploads them to the Eudic backend using browser automation. This tool handles the entire pipeline: downloading, filename sanitization, de-duplication, and batch uploading with AI subtitle support.
